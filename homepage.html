Hello. If you're seeing this, it means that you found my website and clicked on the link. You're smart. Most people don't.

Many people have been called for hits. Generally it means you've done something against the organisation, but sometimes they just call people for fun.

I can't tell you why you've been called, but I can tell you how to save yourself.

I need to keep these pages short, so you'll need to go through links to find more information. See you on the other side.
